TODO:

1. Restructure the layout of About Us container (with SCSS)
    b. The automatic scrolling of the images should also be responsive (when screen size changes)

    *** Bug ***
    1. Automatic Scrolling stops at the 2nd image, it does not scroll to the 3rd image. Instead, it jumps back to the 1st image.
    (affected screen sizes from min 701px to max 900px)

2. NavBar Responsiveness
    a. mobile devices should have a drawer/sidebar navigation
    b. for smaller ipad devices, it should have the drawer/sidebar navigation,
        for larger ipad devices, it should have the top navigation bar.
