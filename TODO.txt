TODO:

1. NavBar Responsiveness
    a. mobile devices should have a drawer/sidebar navigation
    b. for smaller ipad devices, it should have the drawer/sidebar navigation,
        for larger ipad devices, it should have the top navigation bar.

    *** Bug ***
    - Between 1501px and 1517px, navigation links are poorly stylied and the background looks messy when the link is selected.

2. Refactor the code for navBarFunc.js and programs.js

3. Provide comments to describe each function in the js files
